                        <p>     My name is Arnaldo Saenz Tena. I'm a 24 year old, born and raised in Denver, Colorado. I graduated Regis University in 2017 with a triple major in International Business, Management & Finance, as well as a minor in Spanish. You can say I can be a bit of an over achiever.  </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>     I've done a little bit of everything; I've worked as a line cook, a server, a retail salesman, a membership salesman, a teacher's assistant, a tutor, interned at an engineering firm, law firm, accounting firm and an insurance company. After college I became a claim professional who worked to indemnify customers after an accident or loss, a notice of loss coordinator and dispatcher, assisting and deploying multiple teams around the country. I've also been doing construction on the side for a long, long time. That's what I do now full time, but I enrolled in this course to get into the fast paced, exciting world of programming. I hope to find a job in web development after the completion of this course, and set myself up to get into the world of video game development in the future! We'll see how it goes! </p>
